# ExpenseApp
The Expense App was created as a final group project for Durham University's [Tech Up](https://techupwomen.org/) Program. This task was given to us by the consultant group [FDM](https://www.fdmgroup.com/) to improve their method for expense claims via an app. Key features include:

- User can submit an expense claim form to a specific manager.
- Users can look up an claims submitted by them in the database.
- Users can save unsubmitted claims as a draft to come back too. 
- Managers can look up any claims sent to them, approve or reject them. Then comment on the decision made.
- Admin can look up all approved claim to then be processed.
- Various security features including log in. To ensure information is only accessible to permitted users
